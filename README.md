# Sales Metrics Report for KPI Measurement

## Project Overview:
This project involved creating a comprehensive Sales Metrics Report for a client who required a detailed analysis of their sales performance using **Power BI**. The report was designed to measure key performance indicators (KPIs) over a one-month period and to be used as a template for ongoing future sales dataset reports. <br>
The client's objective was to gain actionable insights from their sales data, which included visualizations and DAX measures to evaluate sales performance across various dimensions.<br> 

### Project Objectives:
- Develop a Power BI dashboard that effectively visualizes key sales metrics.
- Create DAX measures for calculating sales performance on a monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis.
- Implement time intelligence in the data model using a custom calendar table.
- Create columns to sort fields like months chronologically in charts.
- Provide insights on the top 3 and bottom 3 performing products.
- Standardize sales amounts across different currencies using a conversion rate to EUR. 

## Key DAX Measures Created:

- **_Sales for the Current Month:_**
 <pre> Sales for the Current Month = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Amount in EUR],
    DATESMTD('Calendar'[Date])
)  </pre>

- **_Sales for the Current Quarter:_**
 <pre> Sales for the Current Quarter = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Amount in EUR],
    DATESQTD('Calendar'[Date])
) </pre>

- **_Total Sales MTD (Month-to-Date) vs Same Period Last Year (MTD LY):_**
 <pre> Total Sales MTD = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Amount in EUR],
    DATESMTD('Calendar'[Date])
)

Total Sales MTD LY = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Amount in EUR],
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DATESMTD('Calendar'[Date]))
) </pre>

- **_Total Sales QTD (Quarter-to-Date) vs Same Period Last Year (QTD LY):_**
 <pre> Total Sales QTD = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Amount in EUR],
    DATESQTD('Calendar'[Date])
)

Total Sales QTD LY = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Amount in EUR],
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DATESQTD('Calendar'[Date]))
) </pre>

- **_Total Sales YTD (Year-to-Date) vs Same Period Last Year (YTD LY):_**
 <pre> Total Sales YTD = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Amount in EUR],
    DATESYTD('Calendar'[Date])
)

Total Sales YTD LY = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Amount in EUR],
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DATESYTD('Calendar'[Date]))
) </pre>

- **_Active Stores:_**
 <pre> Active Stores = DISTINCTCOUNT('Sheet1'[Store])
   </pre>

- **_Active Customers:_**
 <pre> Active Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT('Sheet1'[Customer])
   </pre>

- **_Unique Items Sold:_**
 <pre> Unique Items Sold = DISTINCTCOUNT('Sheet1'[Product No])
   </pre>

- **_Total Quantity Sold:_**
 <pre> Total Quantity Sold = SUM('Sheet1'[QTY])
   </pre>

- **_Total Transactions:_**
 <pre> Total Transactions = COUNTROWS('Sheet1')
   </pre>

- **_Total Amount in EUR:_**
 <pre> Total Amount in EUR = SUMX('Sheet1', 'Sheet1'[QTY] * 'Sheet1'[PRICE in EUR])
   </pre>
 
- **_Total Amount Sold:_**
 <pre> Total Amount Sold = [Total Amount in EUR]
   </pre>

## Data Model and Time Intelligence:

A custom calendar table was created to implement time intelligence, ensuring accurate date-based calculations. The calendar table was linked to the sales data with a 1-to-many relationship, allowing for dynamic analysis of the data across various time periods (MTD, QTD, YTD).

## Visualizations:
![](dashboard_1.JPG)
- **KPI Dashboard:** The dashboard includes key visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and KPI cards to display sales metrics like total sales, active stores, unique items sold, and more.
- **Top 3 and Bottom 3 Products:** Special visualizations were created to highlight the top 3 and bottom 3 performing products, providing the client with insights into their best and worst sellers.
- **Currency Standardization:** Sales data from different currencies were converted to EUR using a predefined conversion rate, ensuring consistent reporting across the dataset.

## Outcome:
The Sales Metrics Report provided the client with a clear and comprehensive view of their sales performance. The dynamic dashboard and DAX measures allowed for easy tracking of KPIs, enabling the client to make informed decisions based on real-time data. The template created is also scalable, allowing the client to continue using it for future sales datasets with minimal adjustments.

## To help the client effectively use the Power BI template for new sales datasets, here are the steps they can follow for both scenarios: (1) when the datasets are in a folder, and (2) when they are all in one dataset.

### Scenario 1: Monthly Datasets Stored in a Folder
If the client stores individual monthly datasets as separate files within a single folder, the following steps should be followed to update the Power BI report:

#### 1. Organize the Folder:
- Ensure that all monthly datasets are saved in one folder. The datasets should have consistent column names and data formats.

#### 2. Load Data from the Folder:
- Open Power BI and navigate to the Home tab.
- Select Get Data > Folder.
- Browse to and select the folder containing the monthly datasets.

#### 3. Combine and Transform Data:
- Power BI will automatically detect all the files in the selected folder. Choose Combine & Load to merge the data from these files into a single dataset within Power BI.
- If necessary, use the Power Query Editor to clean and standardize the data.

#### 4. Refresh the Power BI Report:
- After combining the data, click Close & Load to bring the updated data into Power BI.
- The Power BI template will automatically update all visualizations and DAX measures with the newly combined data.
- For future updates, simply add new monthly datasets to the folder and click Refresh in Power BI to integrate the latest data.

#### 5. Save and Distribute the Report:
- Save the updated report in Power BI.
- The client can then distribute the report or publish it to Power BI Service for easy online access.

### Scenario 2: All Monthly Data Combined into a Single Dataset
If the client combines all monthly data into a single dataset (e.g., an Excel or CSV file), the following steps should be taken:

#### 1. Replace the Existing Dataset:
- Open Power BI and go to the Home tab.
- Select Get Data > Excel or Text/CSV (depending on the file format).
- Load the combined dataset by navigating to the appropriate file.

#### 2. Ensure Data Consistency:
- Verify that the new dataset has the same structure as the dataset initially used in the Power BI template.
- Use Power Query to adjust data types and apply any necessary transformations to maintain consistency.

#### 3. Refresh the Data Model:
- Once the new dataset is loaded, Power BI will refresh the data model, automatically updating all visualizations and DAX measures.
- Address any discrepancies that may arise (such as missing columns or incompatible data types) before completing the refresh.

#### 4. Save and Share the Updated Report:
- After refreshing, save the updated Power BI report.
- The client can share the report with stakeholders or publish it to Power BI Service for continuous access.
